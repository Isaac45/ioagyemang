However, object scale variation due to drones' swift movement and sparse scenes make damage detection challenging. This paper describes a multi-task framework, EnsembleDetNet, for damage detection and multi-label scene classification by leveraging object detectors and classifiers based on ensemble learning which induces diversity and strength-correlation. Further, a novel attention module that significantly improves EnsembleDetNet by about 5% is proposed via explicit ensembling of parallel and sequential channel and spatial attention maps. Extensive experiments with a public dataset and an onsite verification utilizing a micro drone indicate that EsembleDetNet outperforms state-of-the-art detectors and classifiers under variant evaluation metrics. EnsembleDetNet has the potential to become a new paradigm in ….", tags:["Structural Health Monitoring","Damage Detection", "Deep Learning","Computer Vision"], doi:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580522002692", pdf:"#"},

This study introduces the Guided Detection Network (Guided-DetNet), a framework designed to address these challenges. Guided-DetNet is characterized by a Generative Attention Module (GAM), Hierarchical Elimination Algorithm (HEA), and Volumetric Contour Visual Assessment (VCVA). GAM leverages cross-horizontal and cross-vertical patch merging, as well as cross-foreground-background feature fusion, to generate diverse features that mitigate complex image environments. HEA addresses noisy labeling by utilizing hierarchical relationships among classes to refine instances given an image, thereby eliminating unlikely class instances.

These techniques require large sizes of datasets. However, health institutions are inhibited from sharing their patients' data due to concerns regarding the privacy of subjects. This paper presents a methodology that utilizes Federated Learning (FL) in ensuring the preservation of subjects' privacy during training. We fused two modalities: skin lesion images and their corresponding clinical data. The performance of the global federated model was compared with the results of a Centralized Learning (CL) scenario. The FL model is on-par with the CL model with only 0.39% and 0.73% higher F1-Score and Accuracy performances, respectively, obtained by the CL model. Through extended fine-tuning, the performance difference could be further minimized.
